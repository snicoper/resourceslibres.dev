    "description": "## Welcome\r\n\r\nWelcome to the Django Girls Tutorial! We are happy to see you here :) In this tutorial, we will take you on a journey under the hood of web technologies, offering you a glimpse of all the bits and pieces that need to come together to make the web work as we know it.\r\n\r\nAs with all unknown things, this is going to be an adventure - but no worries, since you already worked up the courage to be here, you'll be just fine :)\r\n\r\n## Introduction\r\n\r\nHave you ever felt that the world is more and more about technology to which you cannot (yet) relate? Have you ever wondered how to create a website but have never had enough motivation to start? Have you ever thought that the software world is too complicated for you to even try doing something on your own?\r\n\r\nWell, we have good news for you! Programming is not as hard as it seems and we want to show you how fun it can be.\r\n\r\nThis tutorial will not magically turn you into a programmer. If you want to be good at it, you need months or even years of learning and practice. But we want to show you that programming or creating websites is not as complicated as it seems. We will try to explain different bits and pieces as well as we can, so you will not feel intimidated by technology.\r\n\r\nWe hope that we'll be able to make you love technology as much as we do!",

And you will be able to download a Django Project Boilerplate too! \ud83d\ude42\r\n\r\nHowever, **this is not a common Django tutorial**.\r\n\r\n**It is much better:** it is like a **check list to create a complex Django project**.\r\n\r\nYou will learn about security issues, different environments for developing and testing, version control repositories, deployment on Heroku, PostgreSQL configuration, and many more things!\r\n\r\nMoreover, while building the TaskBuster project, I\u2019ll try to cover as many Django **Best Practices** as I can.\r\n\r\nEnjoy, and learn as much as you can! \ud83d\ude42",

    "description": "JavaScript lies at the heart of almost every modern web application, from social apps to the newest browser-based games. Though simple for beginners to pick up and play with, JavaScript is a flexible, complex language that you can use to build full-scale applications.\r\n\r\nEloquent JavaScript, 2nd Edition dives deep into the JavaScript language to show you how to write beautiful, effective code. Author Marijn Haverbeke immerses you in example code from the start, while exercises and full-chapter projects give you hands-on experience with writing your own programs. As you build projects such as an artificial life simulation, a simple programming language, and a paint program, you'll learn:\r\n\r\n* The essential elements of programming, including syntax, control, and data\r\n* How to organize and clarify your code with object-oriented and functional programming techniques\r\n* How to script the browser and make basic web applications\r\n* How to use the DOM effectively to interact with browsers\r\n* How to harness Node.js to build servers and utilities\r\n\r\nThis edition is thoroughly revised and modernized to reflect the current state of JavaScript and web browsers, with brand-new material, such as a chapter on code performance in Java\u00c2\u00adScript, and expanded coverage of recursion and closures. All source code is available online in an interactive sandbox, where you can edit the code, run it, and see its output instantly.\r\n\r\nIsn't it time you became fluent in the language of the Web?",

Its purpose is to instill in you, the reader, practices that jQuery developers take as common knowledge. Each chapter contains concepts essential to becoming a seasoned jQuery developer.\r\n\r\nThis book is intended for three types of readers. The first is someone who has read introductory books on jQuery and is looking for the next logical step. The second type of reader is a JavaScript developer, already versed in another library, now trying to quickly learn jQuery. The third reader is myself, the author. I crafted this book to be used as my own personal reference point for jQuery concepts. This is exactly the type of book I wish every JavaScript library had available.",

    "description": "If you\u2019ve ever written a non-trivial JavaScript application, you know that creating a code base that\u2019s easy to maintain and scales well over time is no small feat. The complexity only grows as the project becomes larger. While it\u2019s impossible to plan for every change that could possibly happen over the life of a project, you can help future-proof your front-end architecture by designing software that\u2019s pliable and easily extended. Well-designed, extensible architecture can help reduce development and maintenance costs, as bug fixes, enhancements, and new technologies can be incorporated more easily.\r\n\r\nDesigning Scalable JavaScript Applications helps you start thinking about which tools and frameworks you\u2019ll use and which design patterns you\u2019ll implement. This book brings together excerpts from four different Manning titles selected by Emmit Scott, the author of SPA Design and Architecture. These chapters are great starting points for understanding how to build better JavaScript applications. They introduce some fundamental concepts for creating clean, loosely coupled code, and show you how to make your development process more productive and efficient.",

    "description": "Bienvenue \u00e0 toutes et \u00e0 tous,\r\n\r\nQui n'a jamais entendu parler du JavaScript ? Cr\u00e9\u00e9 dans les ann\u00e9es 90 en tant que simple langage de script, JavaScript est d\u00e9sormais un des poids lourds du d\u00e9veloppement Web ! Qui plus est, il se d\u00e9mocratise au sein d'autres environnements comme les serveurs avec le c\u00e9l\u00e8bre Node.js, les applications pour smartphones et tablettes, avec PhoneGap d'Adobe, les applications pour Windows 8, mais aussi les logiciels multiplateformes.\r\n\r\nBref, JavaScript est partout ! Mais avant de se targuer de cr\u00e9er des applications pour serveurs, tablettes et Windows, il faut d'abord apprendre la base et s'int\u00e9resser aux origines : le JavaScript au sein des pages Web. Et \u00e7a tombe bien ; c'est le sujet de ce cours. Chemin faisant, vous apprendrez la structure du langage, \u00e0 manipuler les \u00e9v\u00e9nements, interagir avec les \u00e9l\u00e9ments HTML, dialoguer avec le serveur, faire un syst\u00e8me d'envoi d'images, faire un peu de dessin et des animations, et bien d'autres choses!\r\n\r\nCe cours va principalement aborder l'usage du JavaScript dans l'environnement d'un navigateur Web. Il est donc de rigueur que vous soyez \u00e0 l'aise avec le CSS mais surtout le HTML. Le PHP est un plus, mais vous n'en aurez r\u00e9ellement besoin que lorsque nous aborderons la partie d\u00e9di\u00e9e \u00e0 l'AJAX, qui traite des communications entre le JavaScript et un serveur.\r\n\r\nVoici quelques exemples de ce qui est r\u00e9alisable gr\u00e2ce au JavaScript:\r\n\r\n* Un syst\u00e8me de chat, comme celui de Facebook\r\n* Une suggestion lors de la frappe dans un champ de texte, comme lors d'une recherche avec Google\r\n* Un lecteur de vid\u00e9os ou de musiques, aussi puissant que celui de Youtube, gr\u00e2ce aux balises <video> et <audio>\r\n* Des jeux exploitants la balise <canvas> comme Torus, un Tetris en 3D\r\n* La mod\u00e9lisation 3D d'une Lamborghini affich\u00e9e gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 l'API WebGL et \u00e0 la biblioth\u00e8que Three.js\r\n* Et bien d'autres choses!\r\n\r\nSur ce, bonne lecture!",

    "description": "CoffeeScript is a little language that compiles to JavaScript created by Jeremy Ashkenas. This is an evolution of JavaScript that hides its bad parts and exposes the good parts. It's syntax is inspired by Ruby and Python and brings many features from these two languages.\r\n\r\nWhy is CoffeeScript better than writing pure JavaScript? First of all CoffeeScript allows you to actually write less and do more (yep, exactly like jQuery:smile:). The amount of code that you'll need to write reduces significantly \u2014 you're geeting rid of curly brackets, semicolons and you are getting lots of syntactic sugar. Moreover it adds usefull features like classes and inheritance which have not yet arrived natively to JavaScript.\r\n\r\nBut still, **coffee** code compiles to **JavaScript** so in order to write programs in CoffeeScript you need to know JavaScript. It is impossible to write well sctutured and good working scripts without understanding basics of JavaScript like closures or prototypical model. Knowledge of design patterns in JavaScript will be also usefull as CoffeeScript is using some patterns like **Module pattern, Prototype**.\r\n\r\n## JavaScript Lint\r\n\r\nJavaScript Lint is a JavaScript code quality tool, and running your programs through it is a great way of improving code quality and best practices. The project was based on a similar tool called JSLint. Check out JSLint's site for a great list of issues that it checks for, including global variables, missing semicolons and weak equality comparisons.\r\n\r\nThe good news is that CoffeeScript already 'lints' all of its output, so CoffeeScript generated JavaScript is already JavaScript Lint compatible",

    "description": "This is a book on the functional paradigm in general. We'll use the world's most popular functional programming language: JavaScript. Some may feel this is a poor choice as it's against the grain of the current culture which, at the moment, feels predominately imperative. However, I believe it is the best way to learn FP for several reasons:\r\n\r\n* **You likely use it every day at work.**\r\n\r\n    This makes it possible to practice and apply your acquired knowledge each day on real world programs rather than pet projects on nights and weekends in an esoteric FP language.\r\n\r\n* **We don't have to learn everything up front to start writing programs.**\r\n\r\n    In a pure functional language, you cannot log a variable or read a DOM node without using monads. Here we can cheat a little as we learn to purify our codebase. It's also easier to get started in this language since it's mixed paradigm and you can fall back on your current practices while there are gaps in your knowledge.\r\n\r\n* **The language is fully capable of writing top notch functional code.**\r\n\r\n    We have all the features we need to mimic a language like Scala or Haskell with the help of a tiny library or two. Object-oriented programming currently dominates the industry, but it's clearly awkward in JavaScript. It's akin to camping off of a highway or tap dancing in galoshes. We have to bind all over the place lest this change out from under us, we don't have classes (yet), we have various work arounds for the quirky behavior when the new keyword is forgotten, private members are only available via closures. To a lot of us, FP feels more natural anyways.\r\n\r\nThat said, typed functional languages will, without a doubt, be the best place to code in the style presented by this book. JavaScript will be our means of learning a paradigm, where you apply it is up to you. Luckily, the interfaces are mathematical and, as such, ubiquitous. You'll find yourself at home with swiftz, scalaz, haskell, purescript, and other mathematically inclined environments.",

    "description": "**Preface**\r\n\r\nDesign patterns are reusable solutions to commonly occurring problems in software design. They are both exciting and a fascinating topic to explore in any programming language.\r\n\r\nOne reason for this is that they help us build upon the combined experience of many developers that came before us and ensure we structure our code in an optimized way, meeting the needs of problems we're attempting to solve.\r\n\r\nDesign patterns also provide us a common vocabulary to describe solutions. This can be significantly simpler than describing syntax and semantics when we're attempting to convey a way of structuring a solution in code form to others.\r\n\r\nIn this book we will explore applying both classical and modern design patterns to the JavaScript programming language.\r\n\r\n## Target Audience\r\n\r\nThis book is targeted at professional developers wishing to improve their knowledge of design patterns and how they can be applied to the JavaScript programming language.\r\n\r\nSome of the concepts covered (closures, prototypal inheritance) will assume a level of basic prior knowledge and understanding. If you find yourself needing to read further about these topics, a list of suggested titles is provided for convenience.\r\n\r\nIf you would like to learn how to write beautiful, structured and organized code, I believe this is the book for you.",

    "description": "AngularJS is a super-heroic JavaScript Framework that makes writing single page applications a breeze. It allows you to expand HTML vocabulary by creating custom tags with a help of directive definition object. AngularJS bundled with a set of directives like ngRepeat, ngModel, ngView which make it really easy to build an application but many a times the existing directives fell short considering the need and complexity you are dealing with. And you face the problem head-on when it comes to build directives from ground ups. This book teaches you to extend AngularJS by writing custom directives and motivates to understand the purpose of testing by facilitating Test Driven Development through out the book.\r\n\r\n**AngularJS Directives in Traction** helps you understand how built-in directives work and teaches you to build custom directives on your own. Ultimately, Angular Directives will be the magic revealed for you.",

A front-end web application can be provided by any web server, but it is executed on the user's computer device (smartphone, tablet or notebook), and not on the remote web server. Typically, but not necessarily, a front-end web application is a single-user application, which is not shared with other users.\r\n\r\nThe focus of the book are general information management concepts and techniques concerning\r\n\r\n* Integrity constraints and data validation,\r\n* Enumerations and enumeration attributes\r\n* Unidirectional and bidirectional associations between object types,\r\n* Subtyping and inheritance in class hierarchies.\r\n\r\nThe book can be used both by\r\n\r\n\r\n* Experienced software developers coming from classical object-oriented (OO) programming (with C++/Java/C# etc.) and by\r\n* JavaScript developers.\r\n\r\nThe first group of people may use the book for learning JavaScript. For both groups the book shows how to implement basic OO concepts with plain JavaScript (such as enumerations, associations and class hierarchies) and how to build complete front-end web apps with plain JavaScript, without submitting to the special opinions imposed by frameworks such as jQuery and others.\r\n\r\nThe book comes with the complete JavaScript code of six example apps (with 8658 lines of code) that you can directly run from our web server.

    "description": "You are reading a book about ECMAScript 6 (ES6), a new version of JavaScript. It\u2019s great that we can finally use that version, which had a long and eventful past: It was first conceived as ECMAScript 4, a successor to ECMAScript 3 (whose release was in December 1999). In July 2008, plans changed and the next versions of JavaScript were to be first a small incremental release (which became ES5) and then a larger, more powerful release. The latter had the code name Harmony and part of it became ES6.\r\n\r\nECMAScript 5 was standardized in December 2009. I first heard and blogged about ECMAScript 6 in January 2011, when it was still called Harmony. The original plan was to finish ES6 in 2013, but things took longer and it was standardized in June 2015. (A more detailed account of ES6\u2019s history is given in the next chapter.)\r\n\r\nWith a few minor exceptions, I am happy how ECMAScript 6 turned out. This book describes my experiences with, and my research of, its features. Similarly to ES6, it took a long time to finish \u2013 in a way, I started writing it in early 2011. Like my previous book \u201cSpeaking JavaScript\u201d, I wrote most of it as a series of blog posts. I like the discussion and feedback that this open process enables, which is why this book is available for free online.\r\n\r\nThis book can be read online for free. If you find it useful, please support it by buying a copy. You\u2019ll get DRM-free PDF, EPUB, MOBI files.\r\n\r\nI hope that reading the book conveys some of the fun I had investigating and playing with ES6.\r\n\r\nAxel Rauschmayer",

    "description": "JavaScript Allong\u00e9 is a first and foremost, a book about programming with functions. It\u2019s written in JavaScript, because JavaScript hits the perfect sweet spot of being both widely used, and of having proper first-class functions with lexical scope. If those terms seem unfamiliar, don\u2019t worry: JavaScript Allong\u00e9 takes great delight in explaining what they mean and why they matter.\r\n\r\nJavaScript Allong\u00e9 begins at the beginning, with values and expressions, and builds from there to discuss types, identity, functions, closures, scopes, collections, iterators, and many more subjects up to working with classes and instances.\r\n\r\nIt also provides recipes for using functions to write software that is simpler, cleaner, and less complicated than alternative approaches that are object-centric or code-centric. JavaScript idioms like function combinators and decorators leverage JavaScript\u2019s power to make code easier to read, modify, debug and refactor.\r\n\r\nJavaScript Allong\u00e9 teaches you how to handle complex code, and it also teaches you how to simplify code without dumbing it down. As a result, JavaScript Allong\u00e9 is a rich read releasing many of JavaScript\u2019s subtleties, much like the Caf\u00e9 Allong\u00e9 beloved by coffee enthusiasts everywhere.",

In order to understand it, you should already know object-oriented programming, for example, via a mainstream programming language such as Java, PHP, C++, Python, Ruby, Objective-C, Swift, C#, or Perl.\r\n\r\nThus, the book\u2019s target audience is programmers who want to learn JavaScript quickly and properly, and JavaScript programmers who want to deepen their skills and/or look up specific topics.\r\n\r\nSpeaking JavaScript has four parts:\r\n\r\n* **JavaScript Quick Start:** Learn a safe subset of JavaScript in less than 30 pages.\r\n* **Background:** When, why, and how was JavaScript created? How is it related to other programming languages? What were the important steps that got us to where we are today?\r\n* **JavaScript in Depth:** This part is more of a reference: look for a topic that you are interested in, jump in, and explore. I still tried to make it fun to read.\r\n* **Tips, Tools, and Libraries:** This part gives tips for using JavaScript: best practices, advanced techniques, and learning resources. It also describes a few important tools and libraries.",

    "description": "In software engineering, a design pattern is a general repeatable solution to a commonly occurring problem in software design. A design pattern isn't a finished design that can be transformed directly into code. It is a description or template for how to solve a problem that can be used in many different situations. \r\n\r\n## Uses of Design Patterns\r\n\r\nDesign patterns can speed up the development process by providing tested, proven development paradigms. Effective software design requires considering issues that may not become visible until later in the implementation. Reusing design patterns helps to prevent subtle issues that can cause major problems and improves code readability for coders and architects familiar with the patterns.\r\n\r\nOften, people only understand how to apply certain software design techniques to certain problems. These techniques are difficult to apply to a broader range of problems. Design patterns provide general solutions, documented in a format that doesn't require specifics tied to a particular problem.\r\n\r\nIn addition, patterns allow developers to communicate using well-known, well understood names for software interactions. Common design patterns can be improved over time, making them more robust than ad-hoc designs.",

This book will teach you how to write computer programs using a programming language designed by Google named Go.\r\n\r\nGo is a general purpose programming language with advanced features and a clean syntax. Because of its wide availability on a variety of platforms, its robust well-documented common library, and its focus on good software engineering principles, Go is an ideal language to learn as your first programming language.\r\n\r\nThe process we use to write software using Go (and most programming languages) is fairly straightforward:\r\n\r\n* Gather requirements\r\n* Find a solution\r\n* Write source code to implement the solution\r\n* Compile the source code into an executable\r\n* Run and test the program to make sure it works\r\n\r\nThis process is iterative (meaning its done many times) and the steps usually overlap. But before we write our first program in Go there are a few prerequisite concepts we need to understand.",

This is based on the official tutorial with some additions, I\u2019m happy to accept updates.\r\nThe slides for tutorial are linked on the front page of this document.\r\nIf you\u2019d like some background on programming for parallelised CPUs then the Economist has a nice overview article\r\nentitled \u201cParallel Bars\u201d (June 2nd 2011): [http://www.economist.com/node/18750706](http://www.economist.com/node/18750706).  It doesn\u2019t mention CUDA and\r\nOpenCL but the comment thread has some useful discussion. GvR gets a name-check in the article.\r\nI\u2019ll also give myself a quick plug - I run an Artificial Intelligence consultancy (http://MorConsulting.com) and rather\r\nenjoy training with Python.\r\nI\u2019d like to note that this report is a summary of work over many weeks preparing for EuroPython.  I didn\u2019t perform\r\nstatistically valid tests, I did however run the timings many times and can vouch for their stability.  The goal isn\u2019t to\r\nsuggest that there is \u201cone best way\u201d to do things - I\u2019m showing you several journeys that takes different routes to faster\r\nexecution times for this problem.\r\nIf you\u2019re curious to see how the stock CPython interpreter compares to other languages like C and JavaScript then see\r\nthis benchmark: [http://shootout.alioth.debian.org/u32/which-programming-languages-are-fastest.php](http://shootout.alioth.debian.org/u32/which-programming-languages-are-fastest.php) - you\u2019ll note that\r\nit does rather poorly (up to 100* slower than C!). It also compares poorly against JavaScript V8 which is dynamically\r\ntyped and interpreted - much like CPython.  Playing with comparisons against the JavaScript V8 examples got me\r\nstarted on this tutorial.\r\nTo see how CPython, PyPy, ShedSkin, IronPython and Jython compare to other languages (including C and V8) see\r\nthis benchmark: [http://attractivechaos.github.com/plb/](http://attractivechaos.github.com/plb/) - as shown we can make Python run to 2-6* slower than C with\r\nlittle effort, and the gap with C is shrinking all the time.  The flipside of course is that developing with Python is far\r\nfaster than developing with C!\r\n\r\n**License**\r\n\r\n* Creative Commons By Attribution\r\n(and if you meet me and like this report, I\u2019d happily accept a beer)* Link to: http://ianozsvald.com/2011/07/24/high-performance-python-tutorial-v0-2-from-europython-2011\r\n\r\n**Author Web Site**\r\n\r\n[http://ianozsvald.com/](http://ianozsvald.com/)",

    "description": "Think Java is an introduction to computer science and programming intended for people with little or no experience. We start with the most basic concepts and are careful to define all terms when they are first used. The book presents each new idea in a logical progression. Larger topics, like recursion and object-oriented programming, are divided into smaller examples and introduced over the course of several chapters.\r\n\r\nThis book is intended for students preparing for the AP Computer Science A Exam.  [Here is a PDF document with the Topic Outline for the exam and the corresponding sections of Think Java](http://greenteapress.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/AP.pdf).\r\n\r\nHere are the guiding principles that make the book the way it is:\r\n\r\n* One concept at a time. We break down topics that give beginners trouble into a series of small steps, so that they can exercise each new concept in isolation before continuing.\r\n* Balance of Java and concepts. The book is not primarily about Java; it uses code examples to demonstrate computer science. Most chapters start with language features and end with concepts.\r\n* Conciseness. An important goal of the book is to be small enough so that students can read and understand the entire text in a one-semester college or AP course.\r\n* Emphasis on vocabulary. We try to introduce the minimum number of terms and define them carefully when they are first used. We also organize them in glossaries at the end of each chapter.\r\n* Program development. There are many strategies for writing programs, including bottom-up, top-down, and others.

    "description": "Think DSP is an introduction to Digital Signal Processing in Python.\r\n\r\nThe premise of this book (and the other books in the Think X series) is that if you know how to program, you can use that skill to learn other things. I am writing this book because I think the conventional approach to digital signal processing is backward: most books (and the classes that use them) present the material bottom-up, starting with mathematical abstractions like phasors.\r\n\r\nWith a programming-based approach, I can go top-down, which means I can present the most important ideas right away. By the end of the first chapter, you can decompose a sound into its harmonics, modify the harmonics, and generate new sounds.\r\n\r\nThink DSP is a Free Book.

    "description": "This book is about complexity science, data structures and algorithms, intermediate programming in Python, and the philosophy of science:\r\n\r\n* Data structures and algorithms: A data structure is a collection that contains data elements organized in a way that supports particular operations. For example, a dictionary organizes key-value pairs in a way that provides fast mapping from keys to values, but mapping from values to keys is generally slower.\r\n\r\n* An alorithm is a mechanical process for performing a computation. Designing efficient programs often involves the co-evolution of data structures and the algorithms that use them. For example, the first few chapters are about graphs, a data structure that is a good implementation of a graph---nested dictionaries---and several graph algorithms that use this data structure.\r\n\r\n* Python programming: This book picks up where [Think Python](http://greenteapress.com/thinkpython/index.html) leaves off. I assume that you have read that book or have equivalent knowledge of Python. As always, I will try to emphasize fundmental ideas that apply to programming in many languages, but along the way you will learn some useful features that are specific to Python.\r\n* Computational modeling: A model is a simplified description of a system that is useful for simulation or analysis. Computational models are designed to take advantage of cheap, fast computation.\r\n* Philosophy of science: The models and results in this book raise a number of questions relevant to the philosophy of science, including the nature of scientific laws, theory choice, realism and instrumentalism, holism and reductionism, and Bayesian epistemology. \r\n\r\nThis book focuses on discrete models, which include graphs, cellular automata, and agent-based models. They are often characterized by structure, rules and transitions rather than by equations. They tend to be more abstract than continuous models; in some cases there is no direct correspondence between the model and a physical system.\r\n\r\nComplexity science is an interdisciplinary field---at the intersection of mathematics, computer science and physics---that focuses on these kinds of models. That's what this book is about.\r\nFree books!\r\n\r\nThis book is under the [Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 3.0 Unported License](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/), which means that you are free to copy, distribute, and modify it, as long as you attribute the work and don't use it for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nDownload the LaTeX source code (with figures and a Makefile) in a [zip file](http://greenteapress.com/complexity/complexity.tex.zip).",

    "description": "I believe that the ability to easily build high quality web applications is of critical importance for the growth of a free and open society. This prevents the biggest players from monopolizing the flow of information.\r\n\r\nHence I started the web2py project in 2007, primarily as a teaching tool with the goal of making web development easier, faster, and more secure. Over time, it has managed to win the affection of thousands of knowledgeable users and hundreds of developers. Our collective effort has created one of the most full-featured Open Source Web Frameworks for enterprise web development.\r\n\r\nAs a result, in 2011, web2py won the Bossie Award for best Open Source Development Software, and in 2012 it won the Technology of the Year award from InfoWorld.\r\n\r\nAs you will learn in the following pages, web2py tries to lower the barrier of entry to web development by focusing on three main goals:\r\n\r\nEase of use. This means reducing the learning and deployment time as well as development and maintenance costs. This is why web2py is a full-stack framework without dependencies. It requires no installation and has no configuration files. Everything works out of the box, including a web server, database and a web-based IDE that gives access to all the main features. The API includes just 12 core objects, which are easy to work with and memorize. It can interoperate with most web servers, databases and all Python libraries.\r\n\r\nRapid development. Every function of web2py has a default behavior (which can be overridden). For example, as soon as you have specified your data models, you will have access to a web-based database administration panel. Also, web2py automatically generates forms for your data and it allows you to easily expose the data in HTML, XML, JSON, RSS, etc. web2py provides some high level widgets such as the wiki and the grid to rapidly build complex applications.\r\n\r\nSecurity. The web2py Database Abstraction Layer (DAL) eliminates SQL Injections. The template language prevents Cross Site Scripting vulnerabilities. The forms generated by web2py provide field validation and block Cross Site Request Forgeries. Passwords are always stored hashed. Sessions are stored server-side by default to prevent Cookie Tampering. Session cookies are UUID to prevent Session Hijacking.\r\n\r\nweb2py is built from the user perspective and is constantly being optimized internally to become faster and leaner, whilst always maintaining backwards compatibility.\r\n\r\nweb2py provides its users with the generous freedoms of the LGPL open source licence. If you benefit from it, I hope you will feel encouraged to pay it forward by contributing back to society in whatever form you choose.",

    "description": "Welcome to Google's Python Class -- this is a free class for people with a little bit of programming experience who want to learn Python. The class includes written materials, lecture videos, and lots of code exercises to practice Python coding. These materials are used within Google to introduce Python to people who have just a little programming experience. The first exercises work on basic Python concepts like strings and lists, building up to the later exercises which are full programs dealing with text files, processes, and http connections. The class is geared for people who have a little bit of programming experience in some language, enough to know what a \"variable\" or \"if statement\" is. Beyond that, you do not need to be an expert programmer to use this material.\r\n\r\nTo get started, the Python sections are linked at the left -- [Python Set Up](https://developers.google.com/edu/python/set-up) to get Python installed on your machine, [Python Introduction](https://developers.google.com/edu/python/introduction) for an introduction to the language, and then [Python Strings](https://developers.google.com/edu/python/strings) starts the coding material, leading to the first exercise. The end of each written section includes a link to the code exercise for that section's material. The lecture videos parallel the written materials, introducing Python, then strings, then first exercises, and so on. At Google, all this material makes up an intensive 2-day class, so the videos are organized as the day-1 and day-2 sections.\r\n\r\nThis material was created by [Nick Parlante](http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/%7enick/) working in the engEDU group at Google. Special thanks for the help from my Google colleagues John Cox, Steve Glassman, Piotr Kaminksi, and Antoine Picard.

By \"natural language\" we mean a language that is used for everyday communication by humans; languages like English, Hindi or Portuguese. In contrast to artificial languages such as programming languages and mathematical notations, natural languages have evolved as they pass from generation to generation, and are hard to pin down with explicit rules. We will take Natural Language Processing \u2014 or NLP for short \u2014 in a wide sense to cover any kind of computer manipulation of natural language. At one extreme, it could be as simple as counting word frequencies to compare different writing styles. At the other extreme, NLP involves \"understanding\" complete human utterances, at least to the extent of being able to give useful responses to them.\r\n\r\nTechnologies based on NLP are becoming increasingly widespread. For example, phones and handheld computers support predictive text and handwriting recognition; web search engines give access to information locked up in unstructured text; machine translation allows us to retrieve texts written in Chinese and read them in Spanish; text analysis enables us to detect sentiment in tweets and blogs. By providing more natural human-machine interfaces, and more sophisticated access to stored information, language processing has come to play a central role in the multilingual information society.\r\n\r\nThis book provides a highly accessible introduction to the field of NLP. It can be used for individual study or as the textbook for a course on natural language processing or computational linguistics, or as a supplement to courses in artificial intelligence, text mining, or corpus linguistics. The book is intensely practical, containing hundreds of fully-worked examples and graded exercises.\r\n\r\nThe book is based on the Python programming language together with an open source library called the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK). NLTK includes extensive software, data, and documentation, all freely downloadable from http://nltk.org/. Distributions are provided for Windows, Macintosh and Unix platforms. We strongly encourage you to download Python and NLTK, and try out the examples and exercises along the way.",

    "description": "Python is not a functional programming language, but it is a multi-paradigm language that makes functional programming easy to perform, and easy to mix with other programming styles. In this paper, David Mertz, a director of Python Software Foundation, examines the functional aspects of the language and points out which options work well and which ones you should generally decline.\r\n\r\nMertz describes ways to avoid Python\u2019s imperative-style flow control, the nuances of callable functions, how to work lazily with iterators, and the use of higher-order functions. He also lists several third-party Python libraries useful for functional programming.\r\n\r\nTopics include:\r\n\r\n* Using encapsulation and other means to describe \"what\" a data collection consists of, rather than \"how\" to construct a data collection\r\n* Creating callables with named functions, lambdas, closures, methods of classes, and multiple dispatch\r\n* Using Python\u2019s iterator protocol to accomplish the same effect as a lazy data structure\r\n* Creating higher-order functions that take functions as arguments and/or produce a function as a result",

The core library is focused on the view layer only, and is very easy to pick up and integrate with other libraries or existing projects. On the other hand, Vue is also perfectly capable of powering sophisticated Single-Page Applications when used in combination with [modern tooling](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/single-file-components.html) and [supporting libraries](https://github.com/vuejs/awesome-vue#libraries--plugins).\r\n\r\nIf you are an experienced frontend developer and want to know how Vue compares to other libraries/frameworks, check out the [Comparison with Other Frameworks](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/comparison.html).",
